Hey There! I'm Lydia Gibson (she/her), a second year M.S. Statistics student at California State University East Bay in Hayward, CA. Welcome to my blog *Once Upon a Time Series*! I'm a career changer with previous experience in state and local government as well as retail customer service. I received my B.S. in Economics from University at Albany, State University of New York in May 2011 but I've also dabbled in accounting and fashion design. Join me as I share my experience as a non-traditional grad student and all the adventures that come with it.
